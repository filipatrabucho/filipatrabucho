## 🚀 About Me

Hi! I'm Ana — a full-stack developer who loves turning complex ideas into real, impactful solutions.  
I thrive in every stage of development: **frontend, backend, DevOps, and systems integration**.  
I’ve built tools from scratch, led features into production, and even migrated legacy systems.  
Currently working with **Laravel + React**, but I’m always learning — and always delivering.  

💬 I use **ChatGPT** and **Copilot** daily to supercharge my development process.  
🧠 Fast learner · Adaptable · Problem-solver
