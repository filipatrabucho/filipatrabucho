### 🚀 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building real, impactful solutions.  
From prototypes to production, I love getting involved in every part of the process — **React, Laravel, Node, CI/CD, server setups, and even enterprise integrations like Primavera WebAPI**.  
I learn fast, adapt quickly, and thrive on ownership — started as an intern, took over key projects, and even mentored new devs along the way.

I'm also into AI and automation, using tools like **ChatGPT** and **GitHub Copilot** daily to boost productivity and code quality.
